## Current Projects

### [Terraform Playground](https://github.com/karimkarimson/terraform)
- Terraform has made me go from click-ops to proper DevOps. I love it.

### [Microservices Playground](https://github.com/karimkarimson/microservices)
- Check out how I handle AWS Services, mostly provisioned through Terraform

### [Docker Playground](https://github.com/karimkarimson/docker)
- Docker is a very interesting technology and I love the complexity handling it. It really makes all my broad knowledge come together.
- My projects on here, so far, are simple Docker-Compose configurations with clusters running different tech stacks.

### [Ansible Playground](https://github.com/karimkarimson/ansible)
- As a huge fan of SSH and Terraform, Ansible is a great tool to have in my toolbelt. I'm beginning to get the hang of it and really enjoy it.

### [Coding Challenges](https://github.com/karimkarimson/coding-challenges)
- Coding challanges take my hacking to the next level and really teach me about how to think in code structures. There are much faster and versatile people out there, but I'm learning and that's what counts.

### [My Website](https://aouini.de)
- This is my current website, hosted through GitHub Pages.
- It is minimalistic & contains the information relevant to my profile.
- For accessibility and inclusion it only uses HTML & CSS.
